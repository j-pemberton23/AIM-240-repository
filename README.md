# A bit about myself

## My name is Jeremy the Pemberton, first of my name, ally to the great plains of Arazonia

### The year was 1990, that myself, **Jeremy the Pemberton** came into existence. At the age of 3, I was titled *Ally to the Great Plains* when saving a mountain lion from drowing in the great salt river.

### (2nd Edit) - After looking over the assignment more closely I saw that I was supposed to edit the README file with a short summary of what I have learned from the article on Github. The article was great! Oftentimes I am a lot more likely to do better following an article than a video. What did I learn, I learned how to create an open source repository, start and manage a new brach, change a file and commit, and open/merge a pull request. This article explained really well how to do the basics on github.
